that has sudo priviledges.

host IPs are defined in hosts.txt

Bootstrapping the nodes ensures there is an ansible user and it has the proper ssh keys
Nodes are bootstrapped with the following:
ansible-playbook -v -u ansible boostrap.yaml -i ./hosts.txt --private-key=../config/files/id_riak_rsa

Riak is installed with the following:
ansible-playbook -v -u ansible install.yaml -i ./hosts.txt --private-key=../config/files/id_riak_rsa

A cluster is joined with the following:
ansible-playbook -v -u ansible cluster-join.yaml -i ./hosts.txt --private-key=../config/files/id_riak_rsa

To remove Riak:
ansible-playbook -v -u ansible purge.yaml -i ./hosts.txt --private-key=../config/files/id_riak_rsa
